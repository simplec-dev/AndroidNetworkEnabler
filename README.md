Cordova Android Network Enabler Plugin
=================================

This plugin sets turns wifi on if there is no active connection, and wifi is disabled.

This is a very specific fix for Samsung Galaxy Pro tablets.  If drain the battery, wifi is automatically disabled and does 
not enable when it is charged.
